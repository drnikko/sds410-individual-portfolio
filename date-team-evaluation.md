### Qualitative Evaluation

For each team member, 
1. describe something that they did well.  Where possible, give an example of a situation (big or small) in which they excelled. 
2. describe something that they struggled with.  Where possible, give an example of a situation in which they didn't get it right on the first try, or otherwise struggled to be successful. 
3. identify a growth area for this person.  

_These qualitative evaluations are similar to the reviews that many of us write for our colleagues at all levels.  It's common to write evaluations not only for the people who you may supervise, but for those who supervise you, and for those who are your peers in the organizational hierarchy. These check-ins are designed for you to practice speaking professionally and constructively about your co-workers.   As a result, you may be honestly critical where appropriate, and offer lavish praise where needed.  The text you write here is private and confidential, and I will not share its contents.  However, it is generally best practice to write about others as though they mightÃŸ read it one day._

_ðŸš¨ Remember, your feedback has no impact on their grade in this course. No amount of criticism will lower their grade, no amount of praise will raise it._
