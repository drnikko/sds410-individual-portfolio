This is your repository's readme.  It should contain your professional data science biography.  The biography can take many forms, but for our purposes can look something like:

[Your name] is a data scientist [or other term that applies to you] who graduated from Smith College with a degree in Statisitical and Data Science. They have experience writing software to [xxxx] and recently completed a project [describe your project this term].  They are looking for projects that [what kind of projects do you want to work on? be specific].  In their free time, they [two plesant, generic things].

## Example:

Calla is a software engineer and data scientist who loves solving problems.  They have experience doing large data visualizations, building logistic regressions, and deploying data dashboards using Shiny.  They recently completed a project building an LLM for a government NGO's marketing department.  They're eager to work with teams solving ecological, envrionmental, or climate-focused problems.  In their free time, they ride horses and watch scary movies.

_This is a mediocre example but the point isn't to have a *perfect* bio, but to have a draft of one for when you need it_.
