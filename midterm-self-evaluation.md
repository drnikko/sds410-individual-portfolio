# Midterm self-evaluation

## Description
The mid-term self-evaluation is designed to support your grading conversation at the midpoint of the course.  Your performance in the class is evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Engagement**: How much effort are you putting into this class? How hard are you trying? How responsive and accountable are you to your teammates and your project sponsor? How often are you committing to GitHub?
-   **Learning**: How much have you learned? What have you learned? What are the things that you can do at the end of the class that you couldn't do at the beginning? When you look back on this class, what will you tell people that you learned from this experience?
-   **Proficiency**: How well are you able to perform the tasks required of your project and this class? How knowledgeable are you about the topics covered in class, or the various elements of your project?
-   **Professionalization**: Are you working within the norms of data science? Are you communicating with your teammates and sponsor in direct and clear ways?
  

## Portfolio repo progress
By this time in the semester, a perfectly "complete" individual portfolio should have:
- an individual contributor team evaluation
- this midterm self reflection
- A discussion blog post (if your team has already led a discussion)
- Weekly work logs starting 9/23

## Project repo progress
Your project repo should have
- the team collaboration doc you all made with Megan
- your project plan
- any artifacts from sprint planning meetings (varies by team)



## ✔️ Your task
In this file, reflect on your progress along each of these 4 dimensions.  For each section write between 200 and 500 words.  You can reference specific commits (either in this repo or your project repo), project artifacts, etc. as needed to illustrate your points.
