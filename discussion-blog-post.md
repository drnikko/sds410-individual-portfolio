# Discussion Blog Post

After leading discussion, each team member will write a blog post about the experience of leading two discussions and commit it to their individual portfolio. The file should meet the following criteria:

Be at least 350 words

Contain specific references to specific conversations you had with specific people (these posts are confidential!)

Describe something surprising, unexpected, or that otherwise stuck out to you.

You can focus on technical, social, ethical, (or something else) in your writing.


Discussion Reflection: Data Access, Ownership, and Power
Leading the discussion on “When Data Justice and Environmental Justice Meet” made me think more deeply about something I hadn’t considered before: who actually gets to access and own data, and how that shapes everything else that follows. I centered my discussion question on accessibility: Have you ever relied on data that was difficult to access, understand, or use? How might limited access reinforce existing power structures?
A few people in the class shared examples that surprised me. One person mentioned how many health-care databases are locked behind institutional paywalls or require special access codes that only certain people have. Another one mentioned personal and group biases towards code, research, or analysis done in English. That point really stuck with me: that English-language data or code is often seen as more valid. This points out 2 important points: people’s justified or unjustified personal biases towards data or research in a certain language. This also shows who has more access to the data that is put out there.
Someone else brought up the financial aspect: having to pay to access data, like with APIs or subscription-based news outlets such as The New York Times. We all agreed that this “pay-to-play” model ends up reinforcing existing hierarchies, where academics, corporations, and well-funded researchers can afford to access high-quality data, while smaller community organizations can’t. It reminded me of Nick Srnicek’s idea of platform capitalism, where data itself becomes a commodity controlled by a few powerful actors.
What surprised me most was how easily we take the current system for granted. Publicly available data is often treated like a favor from those in power rather than a right. Even when data is open, it’s usually designed for data scientists or economists, not for the general public. That creates a loop where the same voices keep shaping what kinds of data get collected and what stories are told.
By the end of the discussion, I realized that making data “just” isn’t only about making it free or open — it’s about making it usable and inclusive. That could mean translating documentation into multiple languages, designing better user interfaces for non-experts, or rethinking what kinds of data we even consider worth collecting. It’s not just a technical issue; it’s a question of equity and representation.
