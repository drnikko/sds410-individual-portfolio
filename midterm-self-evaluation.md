# Midterm self-evaluation

## Description
The mid-term self-evaluation is designed to support your grading conversation at the midpoint of the course.  Your performance in the class is evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   **Engagement**: How much effort are you putting into this class? How hard are you trying? How responsive and accountable are you to your teammates and your project sponsor? How often are you committing to GitHub?
-   **Learning**: How much have you learned? What have you learned? What are the things that you can do at the end of the class that you couldn't do at the beginning? When you look back on this class, what will you tell people that you learned from this experience?
-   **Proficiency**: How well are you able to perform the tasks required of your project and this class? How knowledgeable are you about the topics covered in class, or the various elements of your project?
-   **Professionalization**: Are you working within the norms of data science? Are you communicating with your teammates and sponsor in direct and clear ways?
  

## Portfolio repo progress
By this time in the semester, a perfectly "complete" individual portfolio should have:
- an individual contributor team evaluation
- this midterm self reflection
- A discussion blog post (if your team has already led a discussion)
- Weekly work logs starting 9/23

## Project repo progress
Your project repo should have
- the team collaboration doc you all made with Megan
- your project plan
- any artifacts from sprint planning meetings (varies by team)



## ✔️ Your task
In this file, reflect on your progress along each of these 4 dimensions.  For each section write between 200 and 500 words.  You can reference specific commits (either in this repo or your project repo), project artifacts, etc. as needed to illustrate your points.

## Nadira;s Reflection:

If I were to rank this class in terms of effort and priority among the four I’m taking this semester, it would be second out of four. I’ve been consistent with my work, showing up for my team and our project sponsor, and doing my part to move the project forward. Through this class, I’ve learned how to prioritize tasks, divide work efficiently, and build on my teammates’ strengths. I’ve also learned to take pride in the things I do well and to ask for help in the areas where I’m still learning. One thing that I have found hard is how much I get to dedicate to this class. My engagement and the work I have put for this class has varied from week to week. Outside this class, I am the senior class president and work 8-10 hours weekly, and I am also actively applying to jobs. There are some weeks I have put 5 hours and some weeks where all I have gotten done is 3 hours. 



This project has been both challenging and rewarding. Working with people I don’t usually interact with has pushed me to improve how I communicate and collaborate. I’ve also learned how important it is to set the right tone when working with a sponsor: being clear, respectful, and maintaining boundaries. It feels a lot like what work might be like after college, especially in terms of balancing independence with teamwork.
We’re dealing with a large and somewhat overwhelming dataset, and at first, it was hard to know where to start. But I’ve been able to apply tools and techniques from previous classes to make sense of it, which has made me more confident. I still have areas to improve, especially when it comes to handling complex data structures, but I’m using the resources available to figure things out.
One of the biggest things I’ve learned so far is how to communicate clearly and efficiently when things don’t go as planned. Whether it’s during our Friday check-ins or in updates with our sponsor, I’ve seen how much it matters to be transparent and respectful. Overall, I think I’ve grown a lot in how I approach teamwork, communication, and problem-solving in a real-world project setting.
