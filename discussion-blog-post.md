# Discussion Blog Post

After leading discussion, each team member will write a blog post about the experience of leading two discussions and commit it to their individual portfolio. The file should meet the following criteria:

Be at least 350 words

Contain specific references to specific conversations you had with specific people (these posts are confidential!)

Describe something surprising, unexpected, or that otherwise stuck out to you.

You can focus on technical, social, ethical, (or something else) in your writing.
